# Team I Lack Creativity So... (Me Too)

# Plan:
### Underlying container: doubly-linked nodes
### With doubly-linked nodes, all our runtimes for adding, removing, and 
getting will be constant time.

# To-Do List:
## 1. Implement core methods
Since DLLNodes have two equally accessible ends, performing actions on the front and the end of the Deque should be similar.
### addFirst() and addLast() will be almost the same as the add method in LLQueue()
### pollFirst() and pollLast() will be almost the same as the remove() method in LLQueue()
### peekFirst() and peekLast() will just return the private instance variables _first and _last, respectively

## 2. Implement exception handling in the methods that are stated to handle exceptions.

## 3. If time left, add other methods, which all perform similar actions to the methods already written.

# Core Methods in Deque:
### addFirst()
### addLast()
### pollFirst()
### pollLast()
### peekFirst()
### peekLast()
### size()
